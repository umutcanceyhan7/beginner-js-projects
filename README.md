## These programming ideas belong to [strongdan](https://github.com/strongdan) but the codes in this repository belong to me. These are the adviced projects that can be developed on js and I will try to make as much project as possible to improve myself. I must thank to my friend [ismail](https://github.com/ismailgunayy) for showing me this repository.
